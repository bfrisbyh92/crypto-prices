# Crypto Prices

### What kind of React App is this?  
 
 This is a crypto prices tracking app. It uses CoinGecko's free API with 50 free requests/min and no sign up required at all. It gives back plenty of data on crypto. I took that and useed react-chartjs-2 and chart.js to create a line chart of the data. I plan to continue adding to this application with tools I learned in other builds. Specifically this one [build](https://kryptlow.netlify.app/) with it's built in Metamask and smart contract.

 ### Tech Used 

 - [CoinGeckoAPI](https://www.coingecko.com/en/api) 
 - [react-chartjs-2](https://react-chartjs-2.js.org/)
 - [material-ui](https://mui.com/)

 ### User Stories

 - I want to see the prices for my favorite crypos
 - I want as much detail on prices as possible including charts
 - I want charts to show different time periods to visualize
 - I want to be able to change the default primary currency
 - I want a responive design I can use on any device

 ### Things I am adding to this app over time(Not Included yet in this repo)

 So far this app only serves crypto price data. I would like to add a crypto news aggrigation page. A Metamask onClick connection and tipping for the content creator. Possibly a way to send crypto to friends and store crypto onsite wallet.
